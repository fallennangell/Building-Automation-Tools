# Building-Automation-Tools
Project consists of bash and python scripting to rebuild existing tools and build own tools for our service requirements.

As cybersecurity Specialist, I need to use multiple scripting languages to build tools for scanning, automated recon, system administration, automated email checking etc.
So I created.

• Script to automatically update the system

• Email Spoofing Detector

• Mini Nmap

• Password Generator

• Detector of intrusion which sends email as an alert
